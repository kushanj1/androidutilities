androidutilities
================

This project is basically for testing various android functions.
So far I've added my own location code, fused locations and geocoder test functions.

This was created to assist with debugging Arcus Weather, which unfortunately has been having issues with the aforementioned functions.

This will also be a good place to test new android paradigms.
